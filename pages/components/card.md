## Overview of Component Group

Cards are a major component type across the whole site. Cards may be displayed as an individual object or as part of a group. Cards are a responsive element and are meant to fit to 100% of their container.

Cards are made up of primary pieces which may be omitted depending on the context of use. But at a minimum each card is required to have a title and a url target.

- title
- body
- thumbnail
- alt text (thumbnail/image)
- date
- source
- link bar

Cards are meant to be actionable, not just decorative.

### Functionality
- The entire card is the link. Although only the card title displays as a link and shows the hover state.
- The thumbnail is decorative and has its altext set to null
- OnClick/OnTap system displays target page

### Accessbility
The [USWDS](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/card/) recommends using list Functionality for coding cards so that they are accessible.
