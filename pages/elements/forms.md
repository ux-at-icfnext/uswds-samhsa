## Overview
There are a variety of forms across the SAMHSA digital universe.  It is important that the forms have a consistent experience, match SAMHSA branding and follow the guidelines laid out in the [United States Web Design System (USWDS)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/form-controls/)

### Code Snippets
Throughout the Pattern Library, code snippets are available for use. If you are using the USWDS code base, please use that instead.

<a name="globalrules"></a>
## Global Rules
Forms should always be organized on the page in a way that makes sense cognitively to the users. Group elements like contact or demographic information together (see templates below for common groupings). Vertical alignment of forms, rather than using columns, makes them easy to follow and helps to ensure proper tab order.

<a name="longforms"></a>
### Long Forms
Long forms should be broken down into accordions or paging to help keep the user from being overwhelmed or losing their place. This also makes the forms easier to manage on smaller screen sizes. (Please see the template section for suggestions on long form layouts).

<a name="required"></a>
### Required
In accordance with the [USWDS](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/form-controls/) all fields are required unless marked as optional.

<a name="accessibility"></a>
### Accessibility
Accessibility issues are addressed within the specification of each element. However creating clean, semantic code, with elements listed in their proper order will help to ensure that they are readable both on-screen and through screen readers. For more on global accessibility guidance please see the [USWDS](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/form-controls/).

<a name="labels"></a>
### Writing Effective Labels
Accessibility issues are addressed within the specification of each element. However creating clean, semantic code, with elements listed in their proper order will help to ensure that they are readable both on-screen and through screen readers. For more on global accessibility guidance please see the USWDS.

<a name="error"></a>
### Error States
**Use plain friendly language to describe user errors**. Display the particular error next to the field where the error occurred. (see parts of a field) Large forms should also display a message at the top stating the is an error, with the system moving the users view to the top message. (The template section of this guide shows examples of standard errors).

<a name="submissions"></a>
### Form Submissions
Please ensure that once a form passes validation and is submitted, the system displays a success message to the user.

<a name="parts"></a>
### Parts of a Field
Each form element has multiple entities that will likely play a role in its construction. These are:

- Label
- Input field
- Required vs. Optional
- Help Text
- Masking
- Validation
- Error States
- More Information [Tool Tip]({{ site.url }}/tooltip)
- Accessibility Rules

Please be aware of these entities as you review each form element.

## Long Complex Forms
Forms that are too long can create a heavy cognitive load on the user. Even if the questions are simple, long forms can be overwhelming. They are also harder to use on small screens. Using an accordion or paging can help chuck the information into small bites that make them easier to fill out.

Accordion forms keep the user on the same page and so may be better for loading times. However, a paging form can be created on one page and simulate the feel of turning a page. This would ease the issue of loading times between sections.
